                    <h2><i class="fas fa-info-circle"></i> Information We Collect</h2>
                    <p>We collect information that you voluntarily provide when registering, submitting a request, or using features such as QR code generation. This may include your name, email address, and other identifiers. Additionally, we may collect information automatically, such as your device type, IP address, operating system, browser type, time zone, and usage behavior when you interact with our App. This data helps us provide, maintain, and improve our services.</p>
                    <h2><i class="fas fa-qrcode"></i> How OneScan Works</h2>
                    <p>The core functionality of OneScan involves generating QR codes that are scannable only once. To support this, we assign a unique identifier to each QR code and store its scan status. Once the QR code has been scanned successfully, it is marked as expired and becomes invalid for future scans. This ensures data protection and controlled one-time access. Users may optionally enable logs to monitor scan status, though this data is deleted periodically or upon user request.</p>
                    <h2><i class="fas fa-user-check"></i> How We Use Your Information</h2>
                    <p>We use your personal information solely to deliver our services, ensure QR code functionality, analyze usage patterns to improve app performance, provide customer support, and fulfill any legal obligations. We do not use your information for marketing or advertising purposes and do not sell your personal data to third parties.</p>
                    <h2><i class="fas fa-share-alt"></i> Sharing Your Information</h2>
                    <p>We may share your data with trusted third-party service providers that support the operation of our app, such as cloud hosting platforms or analytics providers. These partners are bound by contractual obligations to maintain the confidentiality and security of your information. We may also disclose your data if required by law, regulation, or legal process, or to protect the rights, safety, or property of OneScan, our users, or others.</p>
                    <h2><i class="fas fa-database"></i> Data Retention & Deletion</h2>
                    <p>Your information is stored only as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy. For instance, QR code data is retained until the code is scanned or manually deleted by the user. You may request that we delete your personal information at any time by contacting us directly, and we will comply unless we are legally obligated to retain it.</p>
                    <h2><i class="fas fa-shield-alt"></i> Security</h2>
                    <p>We take appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your information against unauthorized access, loss, or misuse. These include HTTPS encryption, hashed identifiers, and secure cloud storage. However, no system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. You are responsible for maintaining the security of your own devices and account credentials.</p>
                    <h2><i class="fas fa-gavel"></i> Your Rights (GDPR & EEA Residents)</h2>
                    <p>If you are located in the European Economic Area (EEA), the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) provides certain rights regarding your personal data. These include the right to access, correct, delete, restrict processing, or object to our use of your data. You also have the right to data portability and to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority. We will comply with GDPR and similar local laws when applicable.</p>
                    <h2><i class="fas fa-child"></i> Childrenâ€™s Privacy</h2>
                    <p>OneScan is not intended for children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect data from minors. If we become aware that we have collected data from a child, we will delete it promptly. Parents or guardians who believe their child has submitted data should contact us immediately.</p>
                    <h2><i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i> Third-Party Links</h2>
                    <p>Our App may contain links to third-party services or websites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or content of such third parties. We encourage users to read the privacy policies of any third-party sites they visit.</p>
                    <h2><i class="fas fa-sync-alt"></i> Policy Updates</h2>
                    <p>We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time. If we make significant changes, we will provide notice within the app or via email, depending on your contact preferences. Your continued use of OneScan after such changes constitutes your acceptance of the updated policy.</p>
                    <h2><i class="fas fa-envelope"></i> Contact Us</h2>
                    <p>If you have questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy or how we handle your information, you may contact us at:</p>
